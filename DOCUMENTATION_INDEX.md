## 📊 Documentation Maintenance

### When to Archive
- ✅ Session handoffs after work is merged
- ✅ Completed phase plans
- ✅ Deprecated setup guides
- ✅ One-time reviews/audits (architecture reviews, type safety audits)
- ✅ Historical documentation superseded by current versions

### When to Keep Active
- ✅ Current architecture documentation (8 core docs)
- ✅ Active roadmaps and phase plans
- ✅ Operational guides (testing, security, cost optimization)
- ✅ Feature specifications in development
- ✅ README and CLAUDE.md

### Update Frequency
- **README.md:** Monthly (or when major features ship)
- **CLAUDE.md:** After each session (session summary section)
- **DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md:** Monthly (or when docs reorganized)
- **Architecture docs:** Quarterly (or when architecture changes significantly)

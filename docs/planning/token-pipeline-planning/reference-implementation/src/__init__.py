REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION - Spacing Token Pipeline

This is REFERENCE CODE for planning purposes. It demonstrates how to evolve
the existing color token patterns for spacing token extraction.

This package contains:
- models/: Pydantic models for spacing tokens
- extractors/: AI-powered extraction services
- aggregators/: Batch aggregation and deduplication
- generators/: Output format generators (W3C, CSS)
- api/: FastAPI endpoints

NOTE: This code is not production-ready. It serves as a blueprint for
implementing spacing token extraction in the actual codebase.

# Archive (Legacy Docs)

Use this folder like a research library. Everything is dated and grouped by pipeline context.

- `meta/` — Archive changelog/roadmap/migration notes
- `pipeline/`
  - `strategy/` — Roadmaps, capability inventories, status/plan docs
  - `operations/` — Build/deployment/tooling checklists
  - `extraction/` — Extractor patterns, progressive/dual extraction, preprocessing
  - `tokens/` — Token ontology/mappings/export guides (variants under `tokens/variants/`)
  - `design/` — UI/UX notes (shadow setup, color language, accessibility demo)
  - `testing/` — Legacy testing strategies/guides
  - `historical/` — Older v2.x summaries, legacy readmes, superseded status docs

Tip: Prefer the newest date-stamped file in a category as the source of truth; older versions are kept in `historical/` for reference.
